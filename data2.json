Before Weebly he spent 3 years at Kiwi, a mobile gaming company where he oversaw the centralized BI function, quantitative game economy development, and built ensemble learning models to target users based on behavioral patterns. Earlier in his career he enjoyed 5 years at Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund, where he\u00a0led the high risk trades team and\u00a0developed proprietary trading algorithms for new markets and exceptionally large trades. Prior to his time in an office, Raaid played poker professionally from 2005-2007 and developed a unique \"barbell\" play strategy as a countermeasure for poker tracking software, nearly doubling his win-rate against opponents using the software. Raaid holds an MBA from Stanford's Graduate School of Business and a BS in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics & Statistics from Johns Hopkins University's School of Engineering. Parvez Ahammad currently leads the data science and machine learning group at Instart Logic Inc. He earned his PhD in computer vision and machine learning from UC-Berkeley. He has 15+ years of experience in computer vision (CV), machine learning (ML), statistics and signal processing. His work spans diverse application domains such as web application delivery, camera sensor networks, bioinformatics and neuroscience. He is the creator of novel algorithmic technologies such as smartVision (patent pending) @ Instart Logic, OpSIN and Salient Watershed @ HHMI-Janelia, to name a few. Eric Colson is the Chief Algorithms Officer at Stitch Fix, where he specializes in social algorithms. He is also an advisor at several companies: Earnest Inc (consumer lending), Data Elite (Big Data incubator), Mortar Data (Big Data Platform).\u00a0 Previously, he was VP of Data Science & Engineering at Netflix and has held analytics positions at Yahoo!, Blue Martini, Proxicom and Information Resources.\u00a0 He holds a B.A. in Economics, a M.S. in Information Systems, and a M.S. in Management Science & Engineering.
